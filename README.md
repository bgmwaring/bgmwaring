### About Me
My name is Ben and I am a python developer currently studying mathematics at the university of Nottingham. As such, most of my work is mathematics based, designing functions to perform a wide range of computation mainly using Numpy and ScyPi.


:desktop_computer: My experience is in machine learning, specifically optimisation. I am however looking to venture into backend engineering.
